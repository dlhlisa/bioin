## Bioinformatics defination

Bioinformatics: an interdisciplinary field that develops and applies computer and computational technologies to study biomedical questions.
- As a technology, bioinformatics is a powerful technology to manage, query, and analyze big data in life sciences
- As a methodology, bioinformatics is a top-down, holistic, data-driven, genome-wide, and systems approach that generates new hypotheses, finds new patterns, and discovers new functional elements
